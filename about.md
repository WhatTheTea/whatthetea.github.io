I'm Alex, C# developer since 2018. I have experience with desktop development (WinUI, WPF, WinForms) and web as well (Blazor, ASP.NET Core).

For my achievements in software design I was awarded by JASU and VNTU (in my late school and early college period).
In college I have seeked for a part-time job, which leaded me to experience in mentoring and teaching the basics of C#, C++, Python and Unity.

Now I'm working at Digital Cloud Technologies, where we deliver modern fluent apps for Windows
