Hello world,

Idea to create my own blog was chasing me for around half a year at the moment of writing. 
I hope to improve my writing skills and provide a way to retrospect in future.

Today at work I stumbled upon *TFVC*. It was interesting experience, but I managed to define parallels to *git*.
It is somewhat convenient to close tasks from Visual Studio and request for a review. First thing to 
strike me was the lack of branches in *TFVC* though. It's like, what I was expecting for? Of course Subversion inpired
source control tool will be different from *git* xD

But what I was writing, is that it's kinda possible to define what to **X** in *TFVC*, if you want **Y** in *git*:
- If you **check-in** it's like pushing to main branch
- To make commit you need to suspend your work, this will place it on **shelf**
- Shelved changes can be reviewed, thus making available somewhat PR alternative
- Bonus: your """commits""" and """PRs""" are bound to tasks :D

I can't say this is 100% true, but I had to come up with this explanations for myself :P

So, this is it, my first post on my Jekyll blog :)
